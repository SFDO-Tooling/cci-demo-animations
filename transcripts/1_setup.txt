CumulusCI uses an unmanaged package as a container for your project's metadata. 
Enter the name of the package you want to use. 
Package Name [Project]: Food-Bank


Is this a managed package project? [y/N]: N


Salesforce API Version [48.0]: 

Salesforce metadata can be stored using Metadata API format or DX source format. Which do you want to use?

 # Extend Project 
CumulusCI makes it easy to build extensions of other projects configured for CumulusCI like Salesforce.org's NPSP and EDA. If you are building an extension of another project using CumulusCI and have access to its Github repository, use this section to configure this project as an extension. 
Are you extending another CumulusCI project such as NPSP or EDA? [y/N]: 

 # Git Configuration 
 
CumulusCI assumes your default branch is master, your feature branches are named feature/*, your beta release tags are named beta/*, and your release tags are release/*. If you want to use a different branch/tag naming scheme, you can configure the overrides here. Otherwise, just accept the defaults. Default Branch [master]: 

Feature Branch Prefix [feature/]: 

Beta Tag Prefix [beta/]: 

Release Tag Prefix [release/]: 

# Apex Tests Configuration 
The CumulusCI Apex test runner uses a SOQL where clause to select which tests to run. Enter the SOQL pattern to use to match test class names. Test Name Match [%_TEST%]: 

Do you want to check Apex code coverage when tests are run? [Y/n]: Y

Minimum code coverage percentage [75]: 

Your project is now initialized for use with CumulusCI
